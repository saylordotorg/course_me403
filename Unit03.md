**Unit 3: Design Implementation** <span id="3"></span> 
*In this unit, you will engage in a complete design project.  The unit
goes step by step through the basics of a full design, starting with
defining the problem, and moving through identifying the needs and
metrics, generating and selecting the concept, and finally, implementing
and analyzing the project.  While the unit presents this as a linear
process, in practice it is quite iterative.  Assessments allow you to
meet major milestones in the design process while consistently
reexamining previous concepts and design steps as you move forward in
determining the best approach to solve a problem.  At the end of this
unit, you will have gone through an entire design project and will have
produced a final design report and prepared a presentation of your work
and design decision-making.*

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
The general coursework in this unit will take you approximately 9.25
hours to complete. Note that the assessment work in this unit will take
you at least 117 hours to complete.
