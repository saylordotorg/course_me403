**Unit 1: Formulation of Engineering Design** <span id="1"></span> 
*In this unit, we will familiarize ourselves with the various design
steps that we should follow when designing a product or process.  Design
planning is a vital step in the design process; in this stage, we assess
customers’ needs and conduct initial research.  
  
 Once you are familiar with design planning, you need to understand how
to effectively manage the design.  You will learn to treat every design
as a project, where good teamwork and timelines are vital to success. 
You will also learn the importance of properly presenting your ideas in
engineering documents and presentations.*
