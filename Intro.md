Course Syllabus for "ME403: Student Design Project"
---------------------------------------------------

This course will ask you to apply the knowledge you have acquired over
the course of the entire mechanical engineering curriculum.  It draws
upon what you have learned in your courses in mechanics, CAD, materials
and processing, thermal and fluid systems, and dynamics and control,
just to name a few.  This course is equivalent to the capstone course or
senior design project that you would need to complete as a senior in a
mechanical engineering program in a traditional American university
setting. This course begins in Unit 1 by introducing you to the stages
of the design process.  We will then focus on tools and skill sets that
are particularly important for succeeding in a design project, including
design planning, teamwork skills, project management, and design
reporting. Unit 2 covers important design principles and
considerations.  You will learn about economic implications (you must
keep cost in mind while designing!), the ethical, societal, and
environmental impacts of design decisions, and professional aspects of
design work, including the process of securing intellectual property. 
The unit also expands on what you learned in previous materials and
processing coursework by covering material- and process-selection
criteria and approaches. In Unit 3, you will engage in a capstone design
project that applies your knowledge of mechanical engineering.  You will
start by identifying a problem to solve using engineering design.  You
will then explore the needs of the project, developing specific metrics
necessary to achieve customer requirements.  You will engage in both
concept generation and refinement, applying engineering knowledge to
derive potential solutions to the problem.  You will then analyze the
potential solutions, arriving at an ultimate decision to move forward
with implementation, analysis, and final design evaluation.  By the end
of the unit and the course, you will have delivered a solution to a
design problem and created a comprehensive report detailing the design,
how you arrived at it, and a conclusion about its ability to meet the
needs of the problem.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, the student will be able to:

-   Apply engineering design concepts and tools to create the initial
    design of a product.
-   Apply appropriate research techniques to refine the initial product
    design.
-   Apply appropriate resource-planning techniques in the product
    design.
-   Apply appropriate project management tools and techniques in
    planning the design and manufacture of the product.
-   Apply appropriate design codes and documentation in producing the
    design.
-   Calculate engineering costs of a product by using engineering
    economic tools.
-   Create designs that are safe and environmentally friendly.
-   Create designs that meet ethical standards and do not violate
    copyright laws.
-   Create relevant design reports and presentations that meet
    standards.
-   Test, validate, evaluate, and optimize engineering designs.
-   Apply the concepts learned in this course to understand the design
    of various engineering products and processes encompassing various
    technologies.

### Course Information

Welcome to ME403.  Below, please find general information on the course
and its requirements.  
    
 **Course Designer:** Michael Fuqua  
    
 **Primary Resources:** This course is composed of a range of different
free, online materials.  In particular, the course makes extended use of
the following materials:  

-   University of Minnesota: ME4054 [“Design
    Projects”](http://www.me.umn.edu/courses/me4054/index.html)
-   The University of Edinburgh: Dr. Gerard M. Blair: [“Basic Management
    Skills”](http://www.ee.ed.ac.uk/~gerard/Management)
-   The University of Alabama: Dr. Jeff Jackson: ECE 492/494: [“Capstone
    Design”](http://jjackson.eng.ua.edu/courses/capstone/lectures/)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and complete an extensive design
project, broken into individual assessments in Unit 3.  Units 1 and 2
lay the groundwork for understanding how to go forward with the design
project in Unit 3.  To complete the design project, you will need to
complete the following:  

-   Activity 1 and Assessments 2 through 6
-   The Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam. 
In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the final exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 However, the design project and various assessment points along the way
are of great importance.  Do not skip the actual design project or the
assessments, as they represent the spirit and purpose of ME403.  The
project should represent the vast majority of your time spent on this
course.  
    
 **Time Commitment:** The general course work should only take you about
28 hours to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists
the amount of time you are expected to spend on the material in each
subunit.  These should help you plan your time accordingly.  
    
 However, the majority of your time will be spent on completing your
Student Design Project.  You should expect to spend at least 117 hours
on the completion of your design project, although many students find it
necessary to devote as much as 300 to 400 hours to successfully complete
this project.  Since design projects are variable depending on
complexity, there is no absolute minimum or maximum that needs to be
devoted.  However, the nature of the design project will be such that
you will need to devote a great deal of time and effort in order to
properly complete your project successfully.
