**Unit 2: Design Considerations and Principles** <span id="2"></span> 
*To properly engage in a design, you must be able to understand the
various principles and considerations – beyond the basic solution of a
problem – that should factor into your decision making.  For example, a
cost analysis of the product or process must be conducted to make sure
that it is economically and commercially viable.  You must also examine
the impact your design will have on users, society, and the
environment.  You should be aware of the legal and ethical issues
surrounding your design, including its potential for intellectual
infringement (i.e., copyright and trademark violations) at local and
global levels.*
